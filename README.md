# Shortform Projects

Welcome to the sandbox. This repository serves as a centralized space for small-scale, experimental, or exploratory projects that do not require a dedicated repository.


## Why This Exists

Sometimes you just need a place to test an idea, write a few lines of code, or explore a concept without the overhead of a full project. This repo is that place.
